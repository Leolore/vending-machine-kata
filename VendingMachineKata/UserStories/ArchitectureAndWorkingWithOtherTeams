At this time, I will simulate the occurrance of a project event, and describe how the architecture interacts with this.

Especially with embedded projects, such as this vending machine, there are times when the hardware and the software are
being developed to some degree at the same time. Because of this, it will become important to make available smaller
sections of the controller software to test subsections of the hardware, and to show progress to investors.

For this simulation, the project manager approaches the software team on behalf of one of the hardware teams, who is
ready to test their product delivery system hardware.

In its completed form, our software will need to accept money first, and then allow the product selection, make change,
deliver the change and deliver the product. To enable this testing however, we will temporarily refocus on implementing
the tie from the product selection controls/buttons to the product delivery mechanism. To accomplish this, we will
need to implement the event receivers in the vending machine controller, the translation from selection controls to 
delivery codes in the inventory manager, and the call to actually do the delivery from the vending machine controller.
